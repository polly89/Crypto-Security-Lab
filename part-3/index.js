// In January 2022 Okta was breached by hacking group Lapsus$ for 25 minutes. The hackers compromised Okta's system by gaining remote access to a machine beloning to an employee of Sitel,  company subcontracted to provide customer service functions for Okata. Details of the hac were leaked in March, when a member of Lapsus$ shared screenshots of Okta's internal system in a Telegram channel. In a briefing with press and customers held in March, Okta said that the company's security protocols had lmitedthe hackers' access to interal systems. The hackers were oly able to access two active accounts within the SuperUser application, and viewed limited information in certain other applications like Slack and Jira. The hackers were unable to perform configuration changes, MFA or password resets, or customer support "impersonation" events. 
// The company has been working hard to regain their customer's trust. They have committed to:
// 1) Third-party risk management. They will be strengthening their audit procesds for sub-processors and will confirm tat they comply with the new security equirements. They will have to athenticate via Okta's IDAM solution for all workplace applications. Additionally, they will no longe be working with Sykes/Sitel. 
// 2) They will now directly mnage all devices of third parties that access their customer support tools, providing the necessary visibility to effectively respond to security incidents without a third party. As well as limiting the infomration a technical support engineer can vieww. 
// 3) Improved communication with customers.
